               <h3>Series Information</h3>
               <div class="ddi-element"><pre class="content">Housing condition of the people is one of the very important indicators of the socio-economic development of the country. Statistical data on housing condition in qualitative and quantitative terms are needed periodically for an assessment of housing stock and formulation of housing policies and programmes. NSS therefore, started collecting data on housing condition of the dwelling units and basic housing amenities available to  them from its 7th round (October 1953 - march 1954) to the 23rd round ( July  1968 - June 1969 ) with the exception in the 13th and 14th rounds.With bigger sample size, comprehensive surveys were carried out prior to the current one during t he NSS 28th round (1973-74), 44th round (1988-89) and 49th round (January-June 1993).  After a gap of nearly ten years, the fourth survey in the series was conducted in the 58th round during July–December 2002. Continuing in the series,the NSS 65th  round (July 2008-June 2009) was comprehensively dedicated to the all  India survey on housing condition. The present survey on ‘Drinking Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Housing Condition’ (Schedule 1.2) conducted in NSS 69th round (July 2012- December 2012) designed to collect information on housing condition with wider coverage on the aspects of drinking water, sanitation and hygiene.</pre></div>

               <h3>Abstract</h3>
               <div class="ddi-element"><pre class="content">Housing is a basic requirement of human well-being. Along with the requirement of shelter, other facilities in the micro environment of housing such as type of dwelling unit, drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, etc., form vital components of overall quality of life of the population. The survey on drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and housing condition has been designed to collect information on the different aspects of living conditions necessary for decent and healthful living of the household members. Information on these aspects will relate to the household as a whole. On drinking water, important information will be collected on (i) sources and sufficiency of drinking water, (ii) distance to the source of drinking water and (iii) quality of drinking water. On the sanitation facilities, information will be collected on (i) access to latrine, in terms of exclusive use, common use or no access, (ii) type of latrine, (iii) reason for not using latrine for the households which have access to latrine but not using. Some information on micro-environment surrounding the house that will be collected relate to (i) garbage disposal, (ii) drainage arrangement, (iii) problem of flies/mosquitoes. Other information on housing condition like, age of the house, condition of the house, type of the dwelling unit (viz., pucca, semi-pucca and katcha), floor area of the dwelling unit, sources of financing for construction/purchase of houses/flats for residential purpose will also be collected.  

Using the information collected in this survey, important indicators of living facilities that can be developed are: proportion of households (i) using improved sources of drinking water, (ii) getting sufficient drinking water, (iii) fetching drinking water from outside premises,  (iv) using improved latrine facilities, (v) having garbage disposal arrangement, (vi) having draining arrangement. On the characteristics of the house and dwelling unit, important indicators are (i) proportion of households living in different types of dwelling units, (ii) distribution of the households by age the house, (iii) per capita floor area, (iv) proportion of households that undertook construction/purchased houses with different sources of finance. These indictors will be developed, at the national and state level, cross classified by level of living of the households (measured by MPCE), social group, etc.These statistical indicators are required for planning, policy and decision making at various levels both within government and outside. These indicators will be extensively used by various Government Organisations viz., Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Allevation, Town and Country Planning Organisation, Planning Commission, etc. The indicators on improved sources of drinking water and sanitation are required to monitor the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) with respect to drinking water and sanitation. These will also be used by organisations like WHO, UNICEF and various users, researchers and policy makers.</pre></div>
