               <h3>Abstract</h3>
               <div class="ddi-element"><pre class="content">The first nationwide survey on the 'economic condition of slum dwellers in urban cities' was conducted by the NSSO in its 31st round (July 1976 - June 1977).  The survey was restricted to (i) all the 'Class I' towns having 1971 census population one lakh or more and (ii) two 'Class II' towns, viz. Shillong and Pondicherry. The next survey on slum dwellers was carried out in the 49th round (January - June 1993), which covered rural as well as urban areas. After a gap of nearly ten years, the third survey was conducted in the 58th round (July-December 2002), covering only the urban slums.The last survey on slums, which, too, covered only urban areas, was carried out in the 65th round (July 2008 - June 2009).
 In the present round also, the survey is restricted to urban slums only.  This survey, conducted during July 2012 to December 2012.

Slums: The word "slum" will refer to both notified slums and non-notified slums.

Notified slums: These are areas notified as slums by the concerned State governments, municipalities, corporations, local bodies or development authorities. 

Non-notified slums: Also, any compact settlement with a collection of poorly built tenements, mostly of temporary nature, crowded together, usually with inadequate sanitary and drinking water facilities in unhygienic conditions, is considered a slum by the survey, provided at least 20 households live there.  If such a settlement is not notified as a slum, it will be called a “non-notified slum”.

Both notified slums and non-notified slums will be covered by the survey.</pre></div>

               <h3>Description of Scope</h3>
               <div class="ddi-element"><pre class="content">Schedule 0.21 has been framed to collect information on the present condition of the slums and on the change in the condition of some facilities available therein. The schedule was canvassed for each surveyed urban block having slum(s). Thus the schedule was canvassed in the urban sector only. 

Information on each slum, notified or non-notified, found in the entire selected first stage unit (FSU) was collected even if sub-block formation was resorted to. In some cases, the slum covered such a large area that it cuts across more than one FSU, and the selected FSU was part of the slum. In such cases, all the slum particulars recorded was related to only that part of the slum, which fell in the selected FSU. However, if the FSU contained a part of a notified slum with at least 20 households, then the part of the slum falling in the FSU was regarded as a notified slum and the schedule was canvassed accordingly.Descriptive identification of sample UFS block was recorded in Block 0. Block 1contained  identification of sample UFS block. Block 2 contained some salient features of the slum(s) lying wholly or partly within the sample UFS block. Block 3 contained characteristics of slum(s) lying wholly or partly within the sample UFS block. Block 4 recorded change during the last 5 years in condition of the slum(s) lying wholly or partly within the sample UFS block. Particulars of field operations was recorded in Block 5.  Block 6 contained remarks by field investigator / asstt. superintending officer. Comments by supervisory officer(s) was recorded by Block 7.</pre></div>
